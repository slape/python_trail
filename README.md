## The Python Trail
This is a quick, hacky command-line game that I modeled after the old Oregon Trail game.

All of the ascii art was lovingly borrowed from [asciiart.eu](https://www.asciiart.eu).

The game mechanics were modeled after the newer card game version of the [Oregon Trail](https://www.pressmantoy.com/product/the-oregon-trail-card-game/).
